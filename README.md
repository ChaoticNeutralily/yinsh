# TODO

- [ ] cythonize yinsh.py
- [x] make `play_yinsh_with_visuals.py` more modular instead of one big function
- [x] make random_bot take full gamestate so `play_yinsh_with_visuals.py` is bot-generic
- [x] prints initialization for final game state when gui game is closed.
- [ ] implement non-gui play that tabulates results
- [ ] implement ELO
- [ ] make manual features
- [ ] make simple bots
- [ ] copy floyd bot
- [ ] copy other python bots if they're simple enough to directly copy
